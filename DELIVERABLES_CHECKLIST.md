## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Email Notifications**
   - Status changes don't send emails
   - Artists must check manually
   - *Future enhancement planned*

2. **No PDF Generation**
   - Cannot download invoice PDFs
   - Only view in browser
   - *Future enhancement planned*

3. **No Invoice Editing**
   - Cannot edit after creation
   - Must reject and recreate
