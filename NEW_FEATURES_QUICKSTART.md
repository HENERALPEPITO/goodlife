## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Cannot read property 'generate_invoice_number'"

**Cause:** Migration not run completely  
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_invoice_number()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
  current_year INT;
  next_number INT;
  invoice_num TEXT;
BEGIN
  current_year := EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE);
  
  SELECT COALESCE(
    MAX(
      CAST(
        SUBSTRING(invoice_number FROM 'INV-' || current_year::TEXT || '-(\d+)') 
        AS INTEGER
      )
    ), 0
  ) + 1 INTO next_number
  FROM invoices
  WHERE invoice_number LIKE 'INV-' || current_year::TEXT || '-%';
  
  invoice_num := 'INV-' || current_year || '-' || LPAD(next_number::TEXT, 3, '0');
  
  RETURN invoice_num;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### "Available balance is negative or wrong"

**Cause:** Royalty data might be missing  
**Fix:** Check that your royalties table has `net_amount` values:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(net_amount) FROM royalties WHERE artist_id = 'your-artist-id';
```

### Search not filtering

**Cause:** Browser cache  
**Fix:** 
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart dev server

### Delete All button not visible

**Cause:** Not logged in as admin  
**Fix:** 
1. Check user role in Supabase Dashboard
2. Ensure `user_profiles` table has correct role for your user
3. Logout and login again

## 📊 Sample Data (for Testing)

### Create Test Royalties

```sql
-- Add some test royalties for your artist
INSERT INTO royalties (artist_id, track_id, net_amount, usage_count, broadcast_date, exploitation_source_name, territory)
VALUES 
  ('your-artist-id', 'your-track-id', 500.00, 10000, '2024-10-01', 'Spotify', 'US'),
  ('your-artist-id', 'your-track-id', 750.00, 15000, '2024-10-15', 'Apple Music', 'Global'),
  ('your-artist-id', 'your-track-id', 250.00, 5000, '2024-11-01', 'YouTube', 'UK');
```

This gives your test artist $1,500 in available balance to request.

### Expected Result

After running the above:
- Artist sees **Available Balance: $1,500.00**
- Artist can create invoice for up to $1,500
- After creating a $1,000 invoice, balance becomes $500
