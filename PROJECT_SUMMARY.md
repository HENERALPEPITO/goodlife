## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Database**: Run `complete-database-schema.sql` in Supabase
2. **Users**: Create admin and artist test accounts (see QUICK_START.md)
3. **Run**: `npm run dev`
4. **Test**: Login as admin or artist

### Detailed Guide:
See `QUICK_START.md` for step-by-step instructions

## 🔐 Test Credentials

After setup, use these test accounts:

**Admin:**
- Email: `admin@test.com`
- Password: `admin123456`

**Artist:**
- Email: `artist@test.com`
- Password: `artist123456`

## 📈 Key Workflows

### Artist Journey:
1. Login → Artist Dashboard
2. View personal analytics
3. Check royalty statements
4. Request payment when balance available
5. View track catalog (read-only)

### Admin Journey:
1. Login → Admin Dashboard
2. View all artists and stats
3. Upload CSV royalty data
4. Manage tracks and royalties
5. Approve/reject payment requests
6. View system-wide analytics

## 🎨 UI Features

- ✅ Fully responsive design
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions
- ✅ Loading states and skeletons
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Role-based navigation
- ✅ Clean, modern interface

## 🔒 Security Implementation

- ✅ Supabase Auth for secure login
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Role-based UI rendering
- ✅ Server-side data filtering
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Type-safe API calls

## 📝 Testing the System

1. **Login as admin** and upload CSV data
2. **Login as artist** to see the uploaded data
3. **Request payment** as artist
4. **Approve payment** as admin
5. **View analytics** in both roles
6. **Manage tracks and royalties**

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Artist selection in CSV upload is manual (in production, you'd want better artist management)
- No email notifications (could be added)
- No bulk operations UI (could add bulk approve/reject)
- Charts use static colors (could be customizable)

## 🚀 Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Email notifications for payment approvals
- Bulk CSV operations with progress bar
- Advanced filtering and search
- Custom date range reports
- Multi-currency support
- Streaming platform API integrations
- Automated royalty calculations
- Artist profile customization
