## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**Artists:**
```sql
✓ Can view only their own invoices
✓ Can create invoices for themselves
✗ Cannot modify invoice status
✗ Cannot view other artists' invoices
✗ Cannot delete tracks
```

**Admins:**
```sql
✓ Can view all invoices
✓ Can update invoice status
✓ Can delete tracks (including bulk delete)
✓ Can manage entire catalog
✓ Can search across all data
```

### Database-Level Security
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Policies enforce access at PostgreSQL level
- Cannot be bypassed from frontend
- Secure by default

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### Invoice System

#### Auto-Generated Invoice Numbers
```
Format: INV-YYYY-NNN
Example: INV-2025-001, INV-2025-002
- Automatically increments
- Unique constraint enforced
- Resets each year
```

#### Available Balance Calculation
```typescript
Available = Total Royalties - (Approved + Paid Invoices)
```

#### Payment Modes Supported
- Bank Transfer
- PayPal
- GCash
- Wise
- Stripe
- Other (custom)

#### Status Workflow
```
Create → Pending → Approve → Paid
              ↓
           Reject
```

### Enhanced Catalog

#### Search Fields
- Track Title
- ISWC Code

## 📊 Database Schema

### invoices Table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| artist_id | UUID | Foreign key to auth.users |
| amount | NUMERIC(12,2) | Payment amount |
| mode_of_payment | TEXT | Payment method |
| invoice_number | TEXT | Auto-generated unique number |
| status | TEXT | pending/approved/paid/rejected |
| remarks | TEXT | Optional notes |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set on insert |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Auto-updated on change |

### Indexes Created
- `idx_invoices_artist_id` - Fast lookup by artist
- `idx_invoices_status` - Fast filtering by status
- `idx_invoices_invoice_number` - Unique constraint
- `idx_invoices_created_at` - Date sorting

---

## 🎯 Business Logic

### Available Balance Formula
```
Royalties (net_amount) = $2,500
Approved Invoices      = $1,000
Paid Invoices         = $800
─────────────────────────────
Available Balance     = $700
```

### Invoice Creation Rules
1. Amount must be > 0
2. Amount must be ≤ available balance
3. Payment mode is required
4. Invoice number is auto-generated
5. Status defaults to "pending"
6. Artist_id is auto-set from auth

### Admin Action Rules
1. Can only approve/reject pending invoices
2. Can only mark approved invoices as paid
3. Cannot modify paid or rejected invoices
4. All actions require confirmation

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Artist Creates Invoice
```
1. Artist clicks "Request Payment"
2. Frontend calculates available balance
3. Artist fills form (amount, payment mode, remarks)
4. Frontend validates amount ≤ available balance
5. Frontend calls generate_invoice_number() function
6. Frontend inserts invoice with status="pending"
7. Artist sees new invoice in their list
8. Admin sees it in their pending queue
```

### Admin Approves Invoice
```
1. Admin clicks Approve button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Admin confirms action
4. Frontend updates status to "approved"
5. Artist sees updated status
6. Invoice appears in admin's "approved" filter
7. Admin can now mark as paid
```

### Search & Filter Catalog
```
1. User types in search bar
2. onChange event fires
3. setSearchTerm() updates state
4. useEffect triggers filterTracks()
5. Filtered results displayed
6. UI updates instantly
```

---

## 💻 Code Patterns Used

### State Management
```typescript
const [invoices, setInvoices] = useState<Invoice[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
```

### Supabase Queries
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("invoices")
  .select("*, user_profiles(email)")
  .eq("artist_id", user.id)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

### Role-Based Rendering
```typescript
if (user.role === "admin") {
  return <AdminInvoiceList user={user} />;
}
return <ArtistInvoices user={user} />;
```

### Toast Notifications
```typescript
toast({
  title: "Success",
  description: "Invoice created successfully",
});
```

---

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors Used
- Primary Blue: `#2563eb` (buttons, links)
- Success Green: `#059669` (paid, positive)
- Warning Yellow: `#d97706` (pending)
- Danger Red: `#dc2626` (rejected, delete)
- Neutral Gray: `#71717a` (text, borders)

### Typography
- Headings: `text-2xl font-semibold`
- Body: `text-sm`
- Labels: `text-sm font-medium`
- Mono: `font-mono` (invoice numbers)

### Spacing
- Section gaps: `space-y-6`
- Card padding: `p-4` or `p-6`
- Button gaps: `gap-2`

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Production
- [ ] Run database migration in production Supabase
- [ ] Test with real user accounts
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are active
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Check dark mode appearance
- [ ] Verify email notifications (if added)
- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Backup existing data

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Build Command
```bash
npm run build
```

Expected output: No errors, all routes compiled successfully.
