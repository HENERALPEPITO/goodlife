## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Invoice number not generating

**Error:** "Cannot find function generate_invoice_number"  
**Solution:** Run the complete migration script. The function is defined in `invoices-table-migration.sql`

### Issue: Available balance is wrong

**Cause:** Missing or incorrect royalty data  
**Solution:** Check that royalties have `net_amount` values:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_amount) FROM royalties WHERE artist_id = 'your-id';
```

### Issue: Search not working

**Cause:** State not updating  
**Solution:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R), clear cache, or restart dev server

### Issue: Cannot see Delete All button

**Cause:** Not logged in as admin  
**Solution:** Verify user role in Supabase `user_profiles` table. Logout and login again.

### Issue: Permission denied errors

**Cause:** RLS policies not active  
**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'invoices';

-- Should return: rowsecurity = true
```
