# 🎉 New Features Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the two new major features that have been added to the GoodLife Royalty Management System:

1. **Invoice/Receipt System** - Payment request management for artists and admins
2. **Enhanced Admin Catalog** - Improved search/filter and bulk delete functionality

---

## 🧾 Feature 1: Invoice / Receipt System

### Database Setup

**SQL Migration File:** `invoices-table-migration.sql`

Run this migration in your Supabase SQL Editor to create:
- `invoices` table with all required fields
- RLS policies for secure access control
- Auto-generated invoice numbers (format: `INV-2025-001`)
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- Performance indexes

**Key Features:**
- Auto-incrementing invoice numbers per year
- Status tracking: `pending`, `approved`, `paid`, `rejected`
- Row-level security ensures artists only see their own invoices
- Admins can view and manage all invoices

### Artist Invoice View (`/invoices`)

**Component:** `src/components/ArtistInvoices.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ View all personal invoices with status badges
- ✅ Request new payments with auto-generated invoice numbers
- ✅ Display available balance (calculated from royalties minus paid invoices)
- ✅ Select payment mode: Bank Transfer, PayPal, GCash, Wise, Stripe, or Other
- ✅ Add optional remarks to invoice requests
- ✅ Beautiful receipt-like UI with color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Real-time balance calculation

**Payment Modes Available:**
- Bank Transfer
- PayPal
- GCash
- Wise
- Stripe
- Other (custom)

**Status Colors:**
- **Pending** - Yellow badge
- **Approved** - Blue badge
- **Paid** - Green badge
- **Rejected** - Red badge

### Admin Invoice Management (`/invoices`)

**Component:** `src/components/AdminInvoiceList.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ View all invoices from all artists
- ✅ Search by invoice number, artist email, or payment mode
- ✅ Filter by status (All, Pending, Approved, Paid, Rejected)
- ✅ Statistics dashboard showing:
  - Total invoices count
  - Pending invoices with total amount
  - Paid invoices count
  - Total amount across all invoices
- ✅ Action buttons for pending invoices:
  - **Approve** - Changes status to approved
  - **Reject** - Changes status to rejected
- ✅ Mark approved invoices as **Paid**
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for all actions
- ✅ Display artist email and payment details

**Admin Workflow:**
1. Artist submits payment request → Status: `pending`
2. Admin reviews and clicks **Approve** or **Reject**
3. If approved, admin processes payment externally
4. Admin clicks **Mark as Paid** → Status: `paid`

### Invoice Data Structure

```typescript
interface Invoice {
  id: string;                    // UUID
  artist_id: string;             // FK to auth.users
  amount: number;                // Payment amount
  mode_of_payment: string;       // Payment method
  invoice_number: string;        // Auto-generated (INV-2025-001)
  status: "pending" | "approved" | "paid" | "rejected";
  remarks: string | null;        // Optional notes
  created_at: string;           // Timestamp
  updated_at: string;           // Auto-updated timestamp
}
```

### Available Balance Calculation

```typescript
Available Balance = Total Royalties (net_amount) - Total Paid/Approved Invoices
```

Artists can only request payment up to their available balance.

## 📁 Feature 2: Enhanced Admin Catalog Management

### Updated Catalog Page (`/catalog`)

**File:** `src/app/catalog/page.tsx`

### New Features

#### 1. **Real-time Search & Filter** 🔍

**Search Fields:**
- Track Title
- ISWC Code
- Composer Names
- Platform (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
- Territory (Global, US, UK, etc.)

**Implementation:**
- Instant filtering as you type
- Case-insensitive search
- Searches across multiple fields simultaneously
- Shows "No tracks match your search" when no results

**Usage:**
```
Search: "Sunset" → Finds tracks with "Sunset" in title, composer, or any field

```

#### 2. **Delete All Tracks** 🗑️

**Admin-Only Feature:**
- Button visible only to admin users
- Deletes ALL tracks in the catalog
- Two-step confirmation to prevent accidents
- Warning message shows exact count of tracks to be deleted
- Also deletes associated royalty records (due to CASCADE)

**Safety Features:**
- Prominent warning dialog with red styling
- Explicit count of tracks to be deleted
- "Cannot be undone" warning message
- Two-button confirmation (Cancel + Delete All)

**UI Flow:**
1. Admin clicks **Delete All** button
2. Warning dialog appears showing:
   - Total number of tracks
   - Warning about permanent deletion
   - Impact on royalty records
3. Admin must click **Delete All Tracks** to confirm
4. Success toast notification on completion

### UI Improvements

**New Elements:**
- Search bar with icon at the top of the catalog
- Delete All button (red outline style) next to Add Track button
- Enhanced empty states:
  - "No tracks found" when catalog is empty
  - "No tracks match your search" when search has no results

**Responsive Design:**
- Search bar spans full width on mobile
- Button group stacks appropriately on smaller screens
- Table remains scrollable horizontally on mobile

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design Patterns Used

**Color Coding:**
- 🟡 Yellow - Pending (requires action)
- 🔵 Blue - Approved (intermediate state)
- 🟢 Green - Paid/Success (completed)
- 🔴 Red - Rejected/Danger (destructive)

**Icons:**
- 📄 Receipt - Invoices
- 🔍 Search - Search functionality
- ➕ Plus - Add new items
- ✓ Check - Approve
- ✗ X - Reject
- 💰 Dollar Sign - Mark as Paid
- 🗑️ Trash - Delete actions

**Interactive Elements:**
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Loading states during API calls
- Hover effects on table rows
- Disabled states where appropriate
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-friendly table layouts
- Collapsible navigation on mobile
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Proper spacing for finger taps

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**Artists:**
- Can only view their own invoices
- Can only create invoices for themselves
- Cannot modify invoice status
- Cannot view other artists' data

**Admins:**
- Can view all invoices
- Can modify all invoices
- Can delete all tracks
- Full catalog management access

### Input Validation

**Amount Validation:**
- Must be positive number
- Cannot exceed available balance
- Decimal precision to 2 places

**Required Fields:**
- Amount is required
- Payment mode is required
- Invoice number is auto-generated

### SQL Injection Protection

- All queries use Supabase parameterized queries
- RLS policies enforce access control at database level
- No raw SQL strings in frontend code

---

## 📊 Business Logic

### Invoice Number Generation

```
Format: INV-YYYY-NNN
Example: INV-2025-001, INV-2025-002

- YYYY: Current year
- NNN: Sequential number (001-999)
- Resets each year
- Handled by database function
```

### Available Balance Logic

```typescript
const totalRoyalties = sum(royalties.net_amount)
const totalPaidInvoices = sum(invoices.amount WHERE status IN ['approved', 'paid'])
const availableBalance = totalRoyalties - totalPaidInvoices
```

### Search Algorithm

```typescript
// Searches across multiple fields
filter(track => 
  track.title.includes(searchTerm) ||
  track.iswc?.includes(searchTerm) ||
  track.composers?.includes(searchTerm) ||
  track.platform?.includes(searchTerm) ||
  track.territory?.includes(searchTerm)
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Invoice Number Not Generating

**Issue:** Error when creating invoice  
**Solution:** Ensure you ran the complete migration including the `generate_invoice_number()` function

```sql
-- Verify function exists
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'generate_invoice_number';
```

### Available Balance Shows Incorrect Amount

**Issue:** Balance calculation seems wrong  
**Solution:** Check that:
1. Royalties have `net_amount` populated
2. Invoice statuses are correct ('approved' or 'paid')
3. RLS policies allow user to see their royalties

### Search Not Working

**Issue:** Search doesn't filter tracks  
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors, ensure tracks have data in searchable fields

### Delete All Not Visible

**Issue:** Admin cannot see Delete All button  
**Solution:** Verify:
1. User has 'admin' role in user_profiles table
2. Browser cache is cleared
3. User is logged in as admin

### RLS Policy Errors

**Issue:** "Permission denied" or "Row not found"  
**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'invoices';

-- Check policies exist
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'invoices';
```

## 📞 Support

### Common Questions

**Q: How do artists know when their invoice is approved?**  
A: They can check the Invoices page anytime to see the status. Future enhancement could add email notifications.

**Q: Can invoices be edited after creation?**  
A: Currently no. Admins can only approve/reject/mark as paid. To modify, reject the current one and have the artist create a new one.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete all tracks?**  
A: There's no undo. The data is permanently deleted including associated royalties. Always backup before using this feature.

**Q: Can artists see each other's invoices?**  
A: No. RLS policies ensure each artist only sees their own invoices.

**Q: How are invoice numbers guaranteed to be unique?**  
A: The database constraint ensures uniqueness. The generation function uses a transaction-safe sequence.
